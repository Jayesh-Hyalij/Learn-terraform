# Apache Tomcat Documentation

## Introduction

Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language, and Java WebSocket technologies. It provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run.

Tomcat version 9.0 implements the Servlet 4.0 and JavaServer Pages 2.3 specifications and is widely used for developing and deploying Java web applications.

This documentation covers installation, configuration, deployment, management, security, and networking aspects of Apache Tomcat.

## Setup

- Download the latest Apache Tomcat release from the official website.
- Installation involves unpacking the archive and configuring environment variables such as `JAVA_HOME`.
- Tomcat can be run on various platforms and supports multiple Java versions.
- Basic configuration files include `server.xml`, `web.xml`, and context configuration files.

## First Web Application

- Understand the structure of a web application: `WEB-INF` directory, deployment descriptor (`web.xml`).
- Deploy applications by placing WAR files in the `webapps` directory or using the Manager application.
- Basic servlet and JSP examples to verify the setup.

## Deployment

- Use the Apache Tomcat Deployer tool to deploy, undeploy, and manage web applications.
- Support for hot deployment and precompilation.
- Configuration of deployment descriptors and context files.

## Manager Application

- Web interface to deploy, undeploy, start, stop, and reload web applications.
- Access control configuration for the Manager app.
- Useful for managing applications without restarting the server.

## Host Manager

- Manage virtual hosts in Tomcat.
- Add or remove virtual hosts dynamically.
- Useful for hosting multiple domains on a single Tomcat instance.

## Realms and Access Control

- Configure Realms to manage user authentication and authorization.
- Supports JDBC, JNDI, Memory, and DataSource realms.
- Integration with container-managed security.

## Security Manager

- Java Security Manager support to restrict permissions for web applications.
- Fine-grained control over resource access.
- Configuration via policy files.

## JNDI Resources

- Configure and use Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) resources.
- Define resources such as DataSources, mail sessions, and environment entries.
- Resource configuration in `context.xml` or `server.xml`.

## JDBC DataSource

- Configure database connection pools using JDBC DataSource.
- Examples for popular databases.
- Performance tuning and connection management.

## Connectors and Networking

- Configure HTTP, HTTPS, AJP connectors in `server.xml`.
- SSL/TLS configuration for secure communication.
- Connection timeout, max threads, and other performance tuning parameters.

## Logging

- Tomcat uses JULI (Java Util Logging) for logging.
- Configuration of logging levels and handlers.
- Access logs and error logs management.

## Monitoring and Management

- JMX (Java Management Extensions) support for monitoring.
- Integration with external monitoring tools.
- Performance and resource usage tracking.

## Advanced Topics

- Clustering and session replication.
- Load balancing with Apache HTTP Server or other proxies.
- Security considerations and best practices.
- Custom valve and realm implementations.
