hypervisor
1. Hypervisor (Bare Metal)
Runs directly on the host's hardware without an underlying operating system.
- It is installed directly onto the physical machine, just like an operating system (e.g., Windows or Linux).
- It does not need another OS (like Windows, Ubuntu, etc.) to function.
- It manages the hardware itself, including CPU, memory, storage, and network resources.

 Used in enterprise environments for high performance, low latency, and better resource management.

 2. Hypervisor (Hosted)
 Runs on top of a conventional operating system like any other application.
