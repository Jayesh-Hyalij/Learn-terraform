# Terraform Documentation

## What is Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and services using a declarative configuration language. It enables automation, consistency, and repeatability in infrastructure management.

---

## Why Terraform

Terraform is widely used because it provides:

- A declarative language to define infrastructure, making configurations clear and easy to understand.
- Support for multiple cloud providers and services through a rich provider ecosystem.
- Infrastructure state management to track resource changes and prevent configuration drift.
- A plan and apply workflow that allows safe and predictable infrastructure changes.
- Automation and scalability for managing infrastructure across different environments.
- An active community and extensive documentation for support and extensions.

## Terraform Commands and Generated Files

When working with Terraform, several commands create specific files and folders that serve important purposes:

### terraform init

- Creates the `.terraform` directory.
- Purpose: This directory contains the provider plugins and modules required for your configuration. It initializes the working directory for use with Terraform.

### terraform plan

- Does not create new files by default but generates an execution plan.
- Purpose: Shows the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure without applying them.

### terraform apply

- Creates or updates the `terraform.tfstate` file.
- Purpose: This file stores the current state of your infrastructure, mapping your configuration to real-world resources. It is essential for tracking resource changes.

- May create a backup file named `terraform.tfstate.backup`.
- Purpose: A backup of the previous state file to help recover from errors.

### terraform destroy

- Updates the `terraform.tfstate` file to reflect destroyed resources.

### Other files/folders

- `*.tf` files: These are your Terraform configuration files where you define resources, variables, outputs, and providers.
- `.terraform.lock.hcl`: This file locks the provider versions to ensure consistent deployments.

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than manual hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC enables automation, consistency, and repeatability in infrastructure management, reducing human error and improving efficiency.

## Methods Used Before Terraform

Before Terraform, infrastructure provisioning and management were often performed manually through cloud provider consoles or by using custom scripts and configuration management tools such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. These traditional methods were more prone to errors, less consistent, and difficult to scale or automate across multiple environments.

## Why Use Terraform Instead of AWS CloudFormation

While AWS CloudFormation is a native IaC service for AWS, Terraform offers several advantages:

- **Multi-Cloud Support:** Terraform supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more), enabling a unified workflow across different environments.
- **Declarative Language:** Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which is designed to be human-readable and easy to write.
- **Modular and Extensible:** Terraform has a rich module ecosystem and supports custom providers, making it highly extensible.
- **State Management:** Terraform's state file allows tracking of infrastructure changes and supports collaboration through remote state backends.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** Terraform has a large, active community and extensive third-party integrations.
- **Plan and Apply Workflow:** Terraform provides a clear plan of changes before applying them, reducing the risk of unintended modifications.

These features make Terraform a versatile and powerful tool for infrastructure management beyond just AWS environments.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up Terraform on your machine:

1. Download Terraform from the official website: [https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a directory of your choice.

3. Move the `terraform` executable to a directory included in your system's PATH environment variable (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on macOS/Linux or `C:\terraform\` on Windows).

4. Verify the installation by running:

```bash
terraform -v
```

This should display the installed Terraform version.

## How Terraform Works

Terraform uses a declarative configuration language to define infrastructure resources. The typical workflow includes:

1. **Write Configuration:** Define resources, providers, variables, and outputs in `.tf` files.

2. **Initialize:** Run `terraform init` to download provider plugins and initialize the working directory.

3. **Plan:** Run `terraform plan` to create an execution plan showing the changes Terraform will make.

4. **Apply:** Run `terraform apply` to provision or update infrastructure according to the plan.

5. **State Management:** Terraform maintains a state file (`terraform.tfstate`) to keep track of real-world resources and their current state.

6. **Destroy:** Optionally, run `terraform destroy` to remove all resources defined in the configuration.

This workflow enables automation, repeatability, and safe management of infrastructure.

## Remote State and Collaboration

Terraform uses a state file to keep track of the resources it manages. For teams working together, remote state storage is essential to enable collaboration and prevent conflicts. Remote backends such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, or HashiCorp's Terraform Cloud allow storing the state file securely and support state locking to avoid concurrent modifications.

Using remote state enables:

- Shared visibility of infrastructure state among team members.
- Safe concurrent operations with state locking.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

## Best Practices and Security Considerations

- Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your Terraform configuration files.
- Avoid committing sensitive information such as secrets or passwords in your configuration files or state files.
- Use environment variables or secret management tools to handle sensitive data.
- Regularly back up your state files and use remote state with locking.
- Use modules to promote reusability and maintainability.
- Review and test your Terraform plans before applying changes.
- Keep Terraform and provider plugins up to date to benefit from security patches and new features.

## Terraform Modules and Reusability

Modules are reusable, self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that can be shared and composed to build complex infrastructure. Using modules helps:

- Organize and encapsulate infrastructure components.
- Promote code reuse and reduce duplication.
- Simplify management of large infrastructure by breaking it into smaller parts.
- Share best practices and standardize configurations across teams.

Terraform Registry provides a large collection of public modules for common infrastructure patterns.

## Resource Lifecycle and Dependencies

Terraform manages resource creation, update, and deletion based on the dependencies defined in the configuration. It automatically determines the order of operations by analyzing resource references.

You can also customize resource lifecycle behavior using lifecycle meta-arguments such as:

- `create_before_destroy`: Create a new resource before destroying the old one.
- `prevent_destroy`: Prevent accidental resource deletion.
- `ignore_changes`: Ignore changes to specific resource attributes.

Understanding resource dependencies and lifecycle helps avoid downtime and ensures safe infrastructure changes.

## Terraform Versioning and Upgrade Practices

- Use the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file to lock provider versions and ensure consistent deployments.
- Specify required Terraform versions in your configuration to prevent incompatible upgrades.
- Test upgrades in a separate environment before applying to production.
- Review Terraform release notes for breaking changes and new features.
- Use version control to track changes in your Terraform configurations and state.
