# DevOps Overview

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps promotes collaboration between development and operations teams, automation of processes, and monitoring throughout the software lifecycle.

# DevOps Roadmap

1. **Learn the Basics**
   - Understand software development lifecycle (SDLC)
   - Learn about Agile and Scrum methodologies
   - Understand version control systems (e.g., Git)

2. **Master Operating Systems and Networking**
   - Learn Linux fundamentals and commands
   - Understand networking concepts and protocols

3. **Learn Scripting and Programming**
   - Bash scripting
   - Python or other scripting languages

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef

5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI

6. **Containerization and Orchestration**
   - Docker, Kubernetes

7. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Terraform, CloudFormation

8. **Cloud Providers**
   - AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform

9. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

10. **Security and Compliance**
    - DevSecOps practices
    - Tools like SonarQube, Aqua Security
