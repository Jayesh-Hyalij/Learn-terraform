<h1 align="center">ENTRYPOINT</h1>

## 📌 What is ENTRYPOINT?
ENTRYPOINT defines the main command that will always run when a Docker container starts. It is used to configure a container that will run as an executable.

## 🎯 Why We Use ENTRYPOINT? (Purpose)
- To ensure a fixed startup command for the container.
- It allows passing arguments at runtime using docker run.
- Used when you want your container to behave like a specific binary or application.

## 🏭 Use in Industry
In production environments, ENTRYPOINT is used to:
- Launch a web server, API service, database, etc.
- Create containers with a specific and controlled behavior.
- Chain startup scripts or wrappers around the main service.

## 📅 When to Use ENTRYPOINT?
- When the container must always start with a specific command.
- When users may provide dynamic arguments at runtime.
- When creating base images that should be reused with custom arguments.

## ⚙️ How to Use ENTRYPOINT? (Syntax & Process)
```
Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
```
✅ This is the exec form (preferred):
- It does not invoke a shell
- Supports signals properly (e.g., Ctrl+C, Docker stop)

🛑 Avoid the shell form unless necessary:
```
Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2
```
## 🔄 Difference Between CMD and ENTRYPOINT
| Feature     | CMD                                  | ENTRYPOINT                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Overridable | Yes (can override with `docker run`) | Not easily overridable                |
| Purpose     | Default arguments                    | Main command to execute               |
| Use Case    | Set defaults                         | Force execution of a specific command |

## 👉 Often used together:
```
Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```
This allows:
```
bash
docker run myimage         # runs: python3 app.py
docker run myimage other.py  # runs: python3 other.py
```
## 📂 Example Dockerfile with ENTRYPOINT
```
Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt update && apt install -y curl
ENTRYPOINT ["curl"]
```
```
bash
docker build -t curl-img .
docker run curl-img https://example.com
```
📌 This container always runs **curl** as the base command, and lets you pass URLs as arguments.

## ✅ Best Practices
- Use ENTRYPOINT for the main process.
- Combine with CMD for default arguments.
- Prefer exec form (["cmd", "arg"]) for better signal handling.
