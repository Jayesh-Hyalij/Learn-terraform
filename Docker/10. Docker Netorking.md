## 📘 What is Docker Networking?

Docker networking enables containers to **communicate with each other**, with the Docker host, and with external networks. It provides the connectivity layer between containers and is a key component in microservices architecture.

---

## 🎯 Why Do We Need Docker Networking?

- To allow containers to talk to each other
- To enable communication with the outside world (internet or services)
- For **isolating environments** for security and modularity
- For creating **custom virtual networks** similar to physical networks

---

## 🔌 Types of Docker Networks

| Type         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **1. Bridge**   | Default network for standalone containers |
| **2. Host**     | Shares the host's network stack |
| **3. None**     | Disables all networking |
| **4. Overlay**  | Enables communication between containers on different Docker hosts |
| **5. Macvlan**  | Assigns a MAC address to containers for direct network access |
| **6. Custom Bridge** | User-defined bridge network for container isolation and DNS |

---

## 🏭 Commonly Used in Industry

> 🔹 **Custom Bridge Networks** are widely used in the industry.

**Why?**
- Enables container-to-container communication using **names** (via DNS)
- Provides **isolation** and **controlled access**
- Suitable for single-host multi-container applications like microservices

## 🔗 1. Bridge Network

### 📌 What is it?
- The **default network** when using `docker run`
- Provides container-to-container communication on the same host

### 🧭 Purpose
- For connecting standalone containers together with **DNS-based service discovery**

### 🛠️ How to Create and Use

```bash
# Create custom bridge network
docker network create --driver bridge my-bridge

# Run containers on that network
docker run -d --name backend --network my-bridge my-backend
docker run -d --name frontend --network my-bridge my-frontend
```

Containers can now **resolve each other by name** (e.g., `ping backend` from frontend).

---

## 🌐 DNS Enable

### ✅ What is it?
Docker’s internal DNS resolver allows containers to resolve **service names to IPs**.

### 🎯 Why We Need It?
- So containers can find and talk to each other using container **names**
- Works on **custom bridge** and **overlay** networks

Enabled by default on custom networks.

---

## 🖥️ 2. Host Network

### 📌 What is it?
Shares the host’s networking stack. The container does **not** get its own IP.

### 🧭 Why Use It?
- For performance-critical apps
- To avoid port mapping
- When you want the container to behave like a native host process

### ⚠️ Limitation
- No container isolation
- Can't use multiple containers on same port

```bash
docker run --network host nginx
```

---

## 🚫 3. None Network (Null)

### 📌 What is it?
Completely disables networking for the container.

### 🎯 Use Case
- Secure containers that should not communicate with anyone (e.g., batch jobs, restricted scripts)

```bash
docker run --network none alpine
```

---

## 🔧 Network Management Commands

```bash
# List all networks
docker network ls

# Inspect a network
docker network inspect <network-name>

# Connect a container to a network
docker network connect <network-name> <container-name>

# Disconnect a container from a network
docker network disconnect <network-name> <container-name>

# Remove a custom network
docker network rm <network-name>

# Prune (remove) unused networks
docker network prune
```
## 🌐 4. Overlay Network

### 📌 What is it?
A Docker network that spans **multiple Docker hosts**. Used for **multi-host communication** in a **Docker Swarm cluster**.

### 🧪 Use Case
- Running distributed microservices on multiple VMs or cloud instances
- Scalable services with **Docker Swarm**

### 🛠️ How to Create
```bash
# Initialize Docker Swarm (only once)
docker swarm init

# Create overlay network
docker network create -d overlay --attachable my-overlay
```

### ✅ Benefits
- Connects containers **across different hosts**
- Supports **service discovery** and **load balancing**
- Essential for **Swarm-mode applications**

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Requires **Docker Swarm** setup
- Not supported in standalone Docker mode

---

### 🧭 How Overlay Works (Diagram)

```
+-------------------+        +-------------------+
|   Docker Host 1   |        |   Docker Host 2   |
|  Container A      |        |  Container B      |
|   10.0.0.2        |        |   10.0.0.3        |
+--------+----------+        +--------+----------+
         |                            |
         |      Overlay Network       |
         +------------+---------------+
                      |
               Docker Swarm Manager
```

Overlay networks use **VXLAN tunneling** to encapsulate packets and route them across hosts.

---
## 🕸️ 5. Macvlan Network

### 📌 What is it?
Gives containers a **real MAC address** and connects them **directly to the physical network** (bypassing Docker NAT). Each container acts like a physical device on the LAN.

### 🧪 Use Case
- You want containers to appear as **native devices** on the physical network
- Required when interfacing with services that **require Layer 2 visibility**
- Useful in **IoT**, **network emulation**, or **bare-metal integrations**

### 🛠️ How to Create
```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 my-macvlan
```

```bash
docker run --rm -it --network my-macvlan alpine
```

### ✅ Benefits
- Bypasses NAT and gives **full network access**
- Can assign **static IPs** to containers

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Containers **can’t communicate** with the host by default
- Requires proper **host interface configuration**
- More complex setup; may not work on cloud VMs

---
## 🌉 6. Custom Bridge Network

### 📌 What is it?
A **user-defined bridge network** that allows containers on the same host to **communicate by name** and stay **isolated from containers not on the same network**.

### 🛠️ How to Create
```bash
docker network create --driver bridge my-custom-bridge
```

### 🧪 Use Case
- Running **microservices locally** with isolated networking
- Avoid IP conflicts by letting Docker assign subnet/IPs
- Enables automatic DNS resolution (`ping my-service`)

### ✅ Benefits
- **Name-based discovery**
- Full **container isolation** by default
- Control over **subnet**, **gateway**, and **IP address ranges**

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Only works on the **same Docker host**

## 📌 Summary Table

| Network Type     | Container Isolation | Host Access | Cross-Host | DNS Support | Use Case |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Bridge (custom)  | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No       | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes      | Single-host microservices |
| Overlay          | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes      | Docker Swarm, Multi-host apps |
| Macvlan          | ❌ No               | ❌ (default) | ❌ No      | ❌ No       | Native network access, IoT, L2 testing |

---

> 🐳 **Use the right Docker network for the right job** — for local development, custom bridge is enough. For production scaling, overlay is essential. For hardware-level access, Macvlan is powerful but complex.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **custom bridge** for multi-container apps on a single host
- Use **overlay networks** for **swarm** or multi-host applications
- Use **DNS names** instead of hard-coded IPs
- Avoid `--network host` unless necessary
